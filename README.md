> **Project Name:** S-Quant — Quantifying the “S” in ESG
>
> In sustainable finance, the “E” in ESG has clear metrics like carbon emissions, and “G” is backed by governance indicators. However, the “S” — social factors such as human rights, labor conditions, and workplace safety — remains largely unquantified. Banks struggle to incorporate social risks into Sustainability-Linked Loans (SLL), and companies lack reliable, real-time data to demonstrate their social performance.
>
> **S-Quant** is an AI-powered social performance quantification platform built on Google Cloud. Our solution helps banks and enterprises measure both **human rights risks** and **social value creation** in a consistent, auditable way.
>
> On the **risk side**, we use **Vertex AI** to analyze global multi-language news, NGO reports, and anonymized internal grievance logs. We classify and score human-rights-related events (e.g. forced labor, discrimination, harassment, safety incidents) and generate a **Human Rights Risk Score** for each company. All event-level and aggregated scores are stored and updated in **BigQuery**, enabling continuous Human Rights Due Diligence (HRDD).
>
> On the **value side**, we implement a **Social Return on Investment (SROI)** framework. Using company data on employee training, occupational safety programs, diversity initiatives, and community projects, we estimate the monetized social value created and compute SROI ratios for key initiatives. These results are also stored in BigQuery and visualized through dashboards.
>
> Using **Vertex AI, BigQuery, Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, and Looker Studio**, S-Quant provides banks with actionable, data-driven social KPIs that can be integrated into SLL structures. Our goal is to move sustainable finance beyond carbon-only metrics and enable a new generation of loans that truly price in human rights risks and social impact.
